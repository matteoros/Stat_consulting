            Facial mimicry as well as the accurate assessment of one's performance when judging others’ emotional expressions have been suggested to inform successful emotion recognition. Differences in the integration of these two information sources might explain alterations in the perception of others’ emotions in individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder and individuals on the autism spectrum. Using a non-clinical sample (N = 57), we examined the role of social anxiety and autistic traits in the link between facial mimicry, or confidence in one’s performance, and emotion recognition. While participants were presented with videos of spontaneous emotional facial expressions, we measured their facial muscle activity, asked them to label the expressions and indicate their confidence in accurately labelling the expressions. Our results showed that confidence in emotion recognition was lower with higher social anxiety traits even though actual recognition was not related to social anxiety traits. Higher autistic traits, in contrast, were associated with worse recognition, and a weakened link between facial mimicry and performance. Consequently, high social anxiety traits might not affect emotion recognition itself, but the top-down evaluation of own abilities in emotion recognition contexts. High autistic traits, in contrast, may be related to lower integration of sensorimotor simulations, which promote emotion recognition.},

              Background
              Social anxiety disorder ({SAD}) has been linked to academic underachievement, but previous studies had methodological limitations. We investigated the association between {SAD} and objective indicators of educational performance, controlling for a number of covariates and unmeasured confounders shared between siblings.
            
            
              Methods
              This population-based birth cohort study included 2 238 837 individuals born in Sweden between 1973 and 1997, followed-up until 2013. Within the cohort, 15 755 individuals had a recorded {ICD}-10 diagnosis of {SAD} in the Swedish National Patient Register. Logistic regression models tested the association between {SAD} and educational performance. We also identified 6488 families with full siblings discordant for {SAD}.
            
            
              Results
              Compared to unexposed individuals, individuals diagnosed with {SAD} were less likely to pass all subjects in the last year of compulsory education [adjusted odds ratios ({aOR}) ranging from 0.19 to 0.44] and less likely to be eligible for a vocational or academic programme in upper secondary education [{aOR} = 0.31 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.30–0.33) and {aOR} = 0.52 (95\% {CI} 0.50–0.55), respectively], finish upper secondary education [{aOR} = 0.19 (95\% {CI} 0.19–0.20)], start a university degree [{aOR} = 0.47 (95\% {CI} 0.45–0.49)], obtain a university degree [{aOR} = 0.35 (95\% {CI} 0.33–0.37)], and finish postgraduate education [{aOR} = 0.58 (95\% {CI} 0.43–0.80)]. Results were attenuated but remained statistically significant in adjusted sibling comparison models. When psychiatric comorbidities were taken into account, the results were largely unchanged.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Treatment-seeking individuals with {SAD} have substantially impaired academic performance throughout the formative years. Early detection and intervention are warranted to minimise the long-term socioeconomic impact of the disorder.},

It can be severely detrimental to quality of life, with far-reaching consequences for education, employment and relationships. Only a minority of people with social anxiety disorder receive help, but this guideline demonstrates that effective treatments exist and it aims to increase identification and assessment so that people can access interventions to help them overcome this disabling condition. The guideline reviews the evidence for the management of social anxiety disorder across the care pathway in adults, children and young people. It reviews evidence for identification and assessment, and compares the effects of pharmacological and psychological interventions. Interventions for adults are compared using a network meta-analysis. The guideline also contains a chapter on improving access to services and the experience of care for people with social anxiety disorder.},
